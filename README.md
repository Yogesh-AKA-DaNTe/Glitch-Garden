# Glitch Garden

This is a Plants vs Zombies like tower defense game **Glitch Garden** made in _Unity (2018.4.36f1)_.
In this game, there are incoming waves of different types of enemies, you have to plant your own units in 5 rows and make sure that enemies don't get to the left side of the screen.
Current lives are shown as Green Text at the top left corner along with the Yellow Text for solar energy you are left with.
If your lives reaches 0, then You Lose and if you defeat the entire wave of enemies then you proceed to the Next Level, currently 2 levels long.
